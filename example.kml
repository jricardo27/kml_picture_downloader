				<description><![CDATA[Barcelona.<br>Visit the Sant Antoni Market on a Sunday morning and it will be wonderfully bereft of tourists.This market is a treasure trove of vintage books, comics, coins and posters.<br><br>During the week, you can find in this market of Barcelona’s Eixample Esquerra stalls outside selling all kinds of goods, from clothes and shoes to homewares … and, inside, gleaming displays of vegetables, fruit, fish and meat. On Sundays, second-hand books and stamps for collectors captivate the visitors to the historic Mercat de Sant Antoni which retains the architecture, vibrancy and charm of its origins.The Mercat de Sant Antoni was designed by Antoni Rovira i Trias in 1882. Welcoming us inside, above the main entrance, is the Barcelona coat of arms, crowned by a bat, and a plaque showing the year the market was built. The metal structure, so typical of the markets built at the time, spans an interior that covers an entire block in Cerdà’s Eixample district: an area large enough to contain the stalls that supply the neighbourhood of Sant Antoni.One of the most beautiful and original elements is the gallery around the perimeter of the Mercat de Sant Antoni. Green tarpaulins provide walls and ceilings protecting the circular corridor where traders sell clothes and other goods throughout the week, while on Sundays shoppers fill their bags with books, stamps, comics and magazines. A walk around the market, especially on Sundays, is a long-established ritual among the locals and visitors who come to Sant Antoni, in search of a literary relic, to swap stamps or just to browse. At night, when the stallholders shut up shop, they put their goods into wooden drawers and the Mercat de Sant Antoni falls silent. Address: Comte d'Urgell, 1 (prov. Ronda Sant Antoni, 18)Phone: 924 234 287How to get there: Metro: L2 stop Sant Antoni.| Bus: 13, 24, 37, 41, 55 and 64.Web site: www.mercatdesantantoni.comE-mail: mercatsantoni@mercatsbcn.catOpening time: Monday to Thursday, from 7am to 2.30pm and 5.30pm to 8.30pm.

				<description><![CDATA[Barcelona.<br>True Catalonians prefer to take the metro to the relatively less crowded beaches at Sitges.<br><br>There's a certain magic in the air in Sitges. The whitewashed coastal town lies on the Costa Brava, approximately 30km South of Barcelona. For decades Sitges has been a meeting place for people from all walks of life. A sophisticated getaway for young and old, gay and straight, families and friends. The town is full to bursting with classic art deco buildings and the seafront promenade is lined with palm trees. Its 17 beaches are some of the best on the Mediterranean coastline.There is something for everybody in this dynamic beach town. Families can enjoy the safe beaches, ice cream parlours and close proximity to theme and water parks. Bon viveurs will love the French restaurants and the architecture in the old town. Party animals can make the most of the bars and clubs on 'The Street of Sin'. Couples will find romance in the cosy bars, rambling streets and blue seas. Artists will find inspiration from the bohemian atmosphere and the stunning light.Sitges' microclimate means that it enjoys sunshine on average 300 days a year. It also plays host to major film, dance and culture festivals. There are reasons to come to Sitges all year round.<br><br>http://www.sitges-tourist-guide.com/]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Barcelona.<br>El Raval is Barcelona’s slightly seedy underbelly. It’s not a stereotypically tourist area, but if you persevere you’ll be rewarded by a vibrant mix of locals, noise, street art, museums, bars, cool shops and undoubtedly a glimpse at the ‘real’ Barcelona.<br><br>This article will attempt to highlight the good and the bad of one of Barcelona's most controversial and yet interesting neighbourhood.There are so many sides to the vibrant area known as El Raval that it makes it a real challenge to write this article. Raval is an interesting and exciting area in Barcelona however it also has its darker and seedy side that you ought to be aware of. It is certainly not the safest or the cleanest area in Barcelona but it does have a special personality and character all of its own that makes this area a compelling visit.A street in RavalA street in RavalIf you are a seasoned traveller then I would have no hesitation in recommending this area if you want to experience an authentic and stimulating Barcelona neighbourhood. If, however, you are not comfortable with walking through seedy areas or if you are particularly sensitive to street noise then this may not be the area for you.El Raval is part of the second stage development of historic Barcelona and used to be very densely populated until the city walls were removed around the turn of the 20th century and the Eixample area was built. The Southern most part of the El Raval, near the port also used to be famous as the city's red-light district. However in 1988 the government started a huge urban regeneration project and invested a lot of money in cleaning up the area and it has become more modern and safer. However even after this urban clean up there are still locations within Raval that are unsafe at night. There are also localised areas where prostitution continues.Picturesque Street in RavalPicturesque Street in RavalSo what is the appeal to El Raval? The area is vibrant, historic, authentic and full of personality. It is a lively, multi-cultural neighbourhood with a huge variety of tempting cafes, restaurants and bars. The area has also become fashionable being host to a wide variety of art studios, galleries and trendy bookshops, not to mention the imposing MACBA (museum of modern art) and CCCB which is the neighbouring exhibition centre.Clothes shopping is also a pleasure in El Raval thanks to all the little one-off boutiques that line some of the streets giving you a truly unique shopping experience. Unlike the Eixample with its large branded name designer labels, Raval is where you find the small privately owned shops selling clothes you can't find anywhere else.El Raval is alive all through the day and night so you will never be without an eatery to entice you in the early hours of the morning!El Raval offers a central location within walking distance of many of the other popular areas such as the Gothic Quarter and Eixample. The nearest metro stops are on Las Ramblas, Barcelona's most famous street which runs up one side of El Raval.Staying in El Raval also means that you are situated between two of Barcelona's famous food markets, La Boqueria on Las Ramblas and Mercat Sant Antoni. Both places are worth a visit to stock up on fresh fruit to get you through the day or to sample Spain's delicious chorizo or Jamon Serrano.In terms of location El Raval gives you good access to many of the city's main attractions which are within walking distance. However the area can be noisy so be careful if you are easily disturbed when sleeping.The Raval is a prime area for pick-pockets and other unsavoury characters so it is worth being wary when in the area, especially at night. Don't wander down any unlit alleys and be watchful of your belongings everywhere.I love El Raval but it isn't to everybody's taste. It is real, it's not that clean or beautiful, and its certainly not the safest neighbourhood in the city but it does have so much personality and character that it should be a crime]]></description>

				<name>Buñol - Tomatina</name>
				<ExtendedData>
				</ExtendedData>
				<description><![CDATA[Spain.<br>The sunny Mediterranean city of Valencia in Spain is known around the world for its tasty and succulent oranges. And just thirty miles away is Buñol, another town just as famous for its produce. But its notoriety comes from the locals' habit of wearing the produce as well as eating it—big time. Every year, Buñol hosts La Tomatina, the world's largest food fight. Well connected by motorway and rail to Madrid and Valencia, this charming town erupts into a fiery blaze of tomato-hurling on the last Wednesday of every August. The batalla takes place during a week-long celebration filled with non-stop festivities and the ever present anticipation of the monstrous tomato battle that serves as the culmination of the week's events.The Tomatina started during the annual town festival in hour of their patrons San Luis Bertran and the Our Lady of the Forsaken. One parade that takes place during the town fiesta is the parade of the giant heads. As just so happened one year back in the 1940’s some youngsters wanted to participate in this parade but the participants didn’t let them join. In a moment of youthful impulse the kids barged into the parade knocking down one of the participants. When this person got back on his feet, furious with what had occurred, he went to the nearest stall and grabbed the first thing he could find—some tomatoes. I think you can imagine the rest. From that moment on, this festival has grown in popularity year after year.During the week leading up to this epic battle, the 9000 inhabitants of Buñol watch as their town doubles in size. A whole week of parades, fireworks, food and street parties make this town the center of attention in Spain. The night before La Tomatina, the narrow streets beneath the town's medieval bell tower begin to fill with the smell of tomatoes. You will find giant pans of delectable paella simmering, as is tradition, over wood-burning fires each one trying to win the paella contest. After the contest, wine flows and more food is eaten all over the small town until the early hours of the morning.Then, early Wednesday morning, shopkeepers and business owners along the Plaza Mayor of the town set about covering windows and doors in preparation for the upcoming street brawl. Large trucks rumble up the cobblestone streets and arrive in the crowd-filled square ready to unload their haul of tomatoes for the crowd to use. Like many parties, this one doesn’t begin until the sound of an exploding bottle rocket lets the crowd know it is time to start throwing. On the back of the trucks there are townspeople unloading the tomatoes and pelting the crowd with some of the 120 tons of sloppy, squishy tomatoes trucked in from Chilches in Castellon.Dressed in clothing doomed for the recycling bin, more than 20,000 revelers find the nearest target to hit or anything else that strays within range of their hand-crushed veggie blobs. Soon the streets are awash in seeds, pulp and tomato guts that will shortly leave the cobblestoned streets spotless—thanks to the acidity of the tomatoes—after being hosed down with water. This insanity ensues for exactly one hour until it ends the same way it began—with the sound of a bottle rocket.If you plan on visiting the Tomatina be aware that you must now pay a municipal tax to participate which you can purchase beforehand. Because this fiesta has increased in popularity, there is now a limit to people that can participate (20,000). Also for those taking part in the Tomatina and would like to take some pictures for posterity, remember: anyone with a camera will be considered a prime target. You have been warned!Tomatina - FactoidsCelebrated on the last Wednesday of the month of August.There is no political or religious significance to La Tomatina, it's just good, messy fun.Participants who show up from around the world: 20,000.Number of tomatoes used: over 120,000 pounds of tomatoes!After the battle, you can hose off the splatter on the riverbank, where the town slaps]]></description>

Linger in a backstreet cafe along the way and experience some local bonhomie without the tourist gloss.<br>As far back as the 5th century, the Alfama was inhabited by the Visigoths, and remnants of a Visigothic town wall remain. But it was the Moors who gave the district its shape and atmosphere. In Moorish times this was an upper-class residential area. After earthquakes brought down many of its mansions (and post-Moorish churches) it reverted to a working-class, fisherfolk quarter. It was one of the few districts to ride out the 1755 earthquake.<br>With narrow lanes of residential houses and grocery stores, it has a distinct village atmosphere; you can quickly feel like an intruder if you take a wrong turn into someone's backyard. Early morning is the best time to catch a more traditional scene, when women sell fresh fish from their doorways. For a real rough-and-tumble atmosphere, visit during the Festas dos Santos Populares in June.<br><br><br>Read more: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/lisbon/sights/neighbourhoods-villages/alfama#ixzz3UWlASfJu]]></description>

The mosteiro is the stuff of pure fantasy; a fusion of Diogo de Boitaca’s creative vision and the spice and pepper dosh of Manuel I, who commissioned it to trumpet Vasco da Gama’s discovery of a sea route to India in 1498.<br>Wrought for the glory of God, Jerónimos was once populated by monks of the Order of St Jerome, whose spiritual job for four centuries was to comfort sailors and pray for the king’s soul. When the order was dissolved in 1833, the monastery was used as a school and orphanage until about 1940.<br>Entering the church through the western portal, you’ll notice tree-trunk-like columns that seem to grow into the ceiling, which is itself a spiderweb of stone. Windows cast a soft golden light over the church. Superstar Vasco da Gama is interred in the lower chancel, just left of the entrance, opposite venerated 16th-century poet Luís Vaz de Camões. From the upper choir, there’s a superb view of the church; the rows of seats are Portugal’s first Renaissance woodcarvings.<br>There’s nothing like the moment you walk into the honey-stone Manueline cloisters , dripping with organic detail in their delicately scalloped arches, twisting auger-shell turrets and columns intertwined with leaves, vines and knots. It’s just wow. Keep an eye out for symbols of the age like the armillary sphere and the cross of the Military Order, plus gargoyles and fantastical beasties on the upper balustrade.<br>If you plan to visit both the monastery and Torre de Belém , you can save a little by purchasing a €12 admission pass valid for both, or €16 including the Museu Nacional de Arqueologia .<br><br><br>Read more: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/lisbon/sights/religious/mosteiro-dos-jeronimos#ixzz3UWmQEUY5]]></description>

Long closed to the public, the Casa reopened in 2012 to house a small museum dedicated to José Saramago (1922–2010), Portugal's most famous writer. Known for his discursive, cynical and darkly humourous novels, Saramago gained worldwide attention after winning the Nobel Prize in 1998. His best works mine the depth of the human experience and are often set in a uniquely Portuguese landscape. Stop in the bookstore to pick up one of his works, and don't miss the olive tree planted out front, taken from his birthplace of Azinhaga.

At its centre rises the dashing equestrian statue of Dom José I , hinting at the square’s royal roots as the pre-earthquake site of Palácio da Ribeira.<br>In 1908, the square witnessed the fall of the monarchy, when anarchists assassinated Dom Carlos I and his son.

				<description><![CDATA[Just few kilometres outside Bangkok but still far enough to not yet have been converted into a full scale tourist attraction is the charming Taling Chan Floating Market. It has everything you need to spend a good half day without having to book a tour and it is far more genuine than the big famous markets. Here you can enjoy a great seafood lunch sitting on the floor with the locals, ride a longtail boat around the nearby klongs (canals) for a 100 baht, do a bit of silly shopping and a lot of food tasting.<br>Then there is Taling Chan floating market, with just enough boats to be called a floating market and the right amount of people to still be enjoyable. Located 12 km outside Bangkok it is still easily accessible without having to get on a tour or even having to wake up at 6 am! If you don't have your own transportation you can ride the BTS until the last station 'Wongwian Yai' then get a taxi for about 150 baht.<br>The entrance of the market is not all that impressive with that green plastic roof sheltering mostly plants and gardening stuff but beyond is the real market with all kinds or sweets, fruits and fun snacks you should really try. Travelling without eating is missing half the pleasure. <br>If you don't want to eat on the floor, you will find some restaurants with plastic tables and chairs near the railway bridge. Restaurants usually have a small illustrated menu so ordering is not too challenging. Worst-case scenario just point at what you'd like on your neighbour's table. Four of five of these giant prawns cost around 200 baht and taste great!<br>Eating by the river is such a fun experience, you should really try it. Surprisingly while the cook are grilling fishes on their many little boats, hundreds of huge catfish are permanently swarming the waters around the canal. Obviously those massive fish are well aware of their bad taste and their popularity with tourists who just love to feed them colourful pellets all day long. To add to the exotic atmosphere, a group of Thai traditional musicians play for few hours adding a real nice touch to the entire experience.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Bang Nam Pheung floating market should probably be called a 'riverside market' as like many others it only has a few boats parked along the banks, with most of the stalls on solid ground. But with the success of the famous Damnoen Saduak or more recently Amphawa, this popular type of market is flourishing all over Thailand and every village near a river has its own version.<br>Bang Nam Pheung is only few kilometres east side of Bangkok but it is not easy to find or to reach without your own transortation. Because of this it has remained relatively low-key and the proximity to Bangkok makes it a great way to step away from the hectic town and step right into village life.<br>Bang Nam Pheung is located in an unusual loop of the Chao Phraya river nicknamed 'the Green Lung of Bangkok', a surprisingly untouched area clearly visible from the sky and still covered with vegetation despite being so close to town. <br>If your vision of a floating market is a canal crowded with a fleet of wooden boats, this might not be what you have in mind. A complete contrast to touristy Damnoen Saduak, Bang Nam Pheung is a real local market with a lot of interesting food and sweets to try. Whilst it doesn't offer the usual photo opportunity, it still has a plenty of charm.<br>Bang Nam Pheung flaoting market is not vast, but still large enough to entertain you for a morning and signs of further expansion clearly show the success of the place. Exploring the narrow lanes and meandering under very large trees is very enjoyable compared to the over-heated narrow constructions found in other markets. People are very friendly, especially if you are daring enough to sample any of the interesting looking dishes on display. For travellers, it's always fun to try to imagine what this object or that lotion can be used for and Bang Nam Pheung market is definitely full of surprises!<br><br>---<br>The market is on the road Sukhumvit - Thong Thong , follow the signs to go and whether or ring expressway industry. I saw a sign pointing to turn left and follow signs to the door Thong welcome . "City Ammarawithi " straight indefinitely Notice Top Charoen Optical . Turn left and go another 5 km you will come across some honey market .]]></description>
